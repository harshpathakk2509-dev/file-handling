        "### **Q1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?**\n",
        "Interpreted languages execute code line-by-line using an interpreter, making debugging easier but slower. Compiled languages convert code into machine language before execution, resulting in faster performance but requiring compilation beforehand.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q2. What is exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "Exception handling in Python allows programs to manage runtime errors gracefully using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks, preventing crashes and enabling controlled error responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?**\n",
        "The `finally` block ensures that specific code runs regardless of whether an exception occurred or notâ€”commonly used for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q4. What is logging in Python?**\n",
        "Logging in Python is a way to track events during program execution. It records messages at different severity levels (e.g., info, warning, error) using the `logging` module, aiding in debugging and monitoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q5. What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?**\n",
        "The `__del__` method is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It helps release resources or perform final cleanup before the object is removed from memory.\n",

        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q8. What is the purpose of the `with` statement when handling files in Python?**\n",
        "The `with` statement simplifies file handling by automatically managing file opening and closing, ensuring resources are released even if an error occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?**\n",
        "- **Multithreading** runs multiple threads within a single process, sharing memory space.\n",
        "- **Multiprocessing** runs multiple processes independently, each with its own memory, offering better performance for CPU-bound tasks.\n",

        "### **Q11. What is memory management in Python?**\n",
        "Memory management in Python involves allocating and freeing memory during program execution. It uses reference counting and garbage collection to manage memory automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "1. Use `try` to wrap risky code.\n",
        "2. Use `except` to catch and handle exceptions.\n",
        "3. Optionally use `else` for code that runs if no exception occurs.\n",
        "4. Use `finally` for cleanup actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q13. Why is memory management important in Python?**\n",
        "Efficient memory management prevents memory leaks, improves performance, and ensures that resources are used optimally without exhausting system memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q14. What is the role of `try` and `except` in exception handling?**\n",
        "- `try`: Contains code that may raise an exception.\n",
        "- `except`: Catches and handles the exception, preventing program termination.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?**\n",
        "Python uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to automatically detect and delete unused objects, freeing memory without manual intervention.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q16. What is the purpose of the `else` block in exception handling?**\n",
        "The `else` block runs only if no exception occurs in the `try` block. It is useful for separating error-free logic from error-handling logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q17. What are the common logging levels in Python?**\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q18. What is the difference between `os.fork()` and `multiprocessing` in Python?**\n",
        "- `os.fork()` creates a child process by duplicating the current process (Unix only).\n",
        "- `multiprocessing` is a cross-platform module that creates independent processes with better abstraction and control.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?**\n",

        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q20. What is the difference between `file.read()` and `file.readline()` in Python?**\n",
        "- `file.read()` reads the entire file as a single string.\n",
        "- `file.readline()` reads one line at a time, useful for line-by-line processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q21. What is the logging module in Python used for?**\n",

        "```python\n",
        "raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\")\n",
        "```\n",
